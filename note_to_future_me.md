to do what i had in mind

> which is able to:

- have .md file to serve as easy way to create paywalled whatever
- seed those .md files
- able to easily determine if product is purchasable by sub, money(stripe), and/or credits
- easily make new product with webui in admin dashboard
- able to export zip of those .md files/products
- able to import zip md files
  i need to dynamically create products with stripe which means lots of cross checking with updating and creating stripe product objects
